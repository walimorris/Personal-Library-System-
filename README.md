# Personal-Library-System-
A Library Management System for your Personal Collection 

By: Wali Morris 

**NOTE:** **Today 12/29/2019 was second commit. There is still much to add.**

The Personal, or Home Library System, is a command line based tool to track of all your book 
collection needs. Home libraries come in many sizes, but if you fancy reading and keeping
track of the novels you have, then this personal library management system is right for you. 
Each book is given its own personal identification number so you can label, search and keep 
track of books by means other than it's title, author or publisher. Currently, this system 
can store a collection of 10,000 books! The management system will continue to be under 
construction as new features are added; features like checking books out if a friend or 
family member wants to borrow one of your favorites or, if you're a real book enthusist, 
upgrading to hold an even larger collection. Rest assured, this personal management system 
is quite easy to use. Currently, there are three different home menu options to choose from:
Adding a new book to the collection, searching your collection of books by its identification
number, title or author and deleting a book out right.
