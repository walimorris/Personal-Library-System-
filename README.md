# Personal-Library-System-
A Library Management System for your Personal Collection 

By: Wali Morris 

**NOTE:** **Today 12/30/2019 was third commit. There is still much to add.**

The Personal, or Home Library System, is a command line based tool to keep track of all your book 
collection needs. Home libraries come in many sizes, but if you fancy reading and keeping track of 
the novels you have, then this personal library management system is right for you. Each book is 
given its own personal identification number so you can label, search and keep track of books by 
means other than it's title, author or publisher. Currently, this system can store a collection 
of 10,000 books! The management system will continue to be under construction as new features are 
added; features like checking books out if a friend or family member wants to borrow one of your 
favorites or, if you're a real book enthusiast, upgrading to hold an even larger collection. Rest 
assured, this personal management system is quite easy to use. Currently, there are three different 
home menu options to choose from: adding a new book to the collection, searching your collection of
books by its identification number, title or author and deleting a book out right.

Searching is made easy. For instance, if I were to select the search option, there are multiple ways 
to search for a book. You can search by identification number, which is my preferred method and will 
respond with a individual book, if it exists in the library. Here's an example:

Searching by author is great when you need to know all books by a specific author, don't quite remember
the book title or id #? That's okay, searching by author will return all books by that author and you 
can go from there.

Here John McGee was searched, which is still somewhat exact, and all books in the Library by Mr. McGee were
returned. Be careful because searching for John, if you can't really remember the author's full name, will 
return all books by John. Whoever John may be. Though, this can result in a long list of books by John, its 
also great when you can't remember the author but have a small piece of information to search for. So, this 
can also be a good thing. You can't quite remember which John wrote "The Space Adventure". Here's what the 
search for our made up author John McGee resulted in:

Searching by Id is the most proficient. Here's an example:
